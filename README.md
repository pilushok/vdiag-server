# ðŸš— Virtual Diagnostic Server (VDS)

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/Pils48/virtual_ecu/actions/workflows/build&test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Pils48/virtual_ecu/actions/workflows/build&test.yml)

## ðŸ“‹ Project Description

A **Virtual Diagnostic Server** implementing UDS (Unified Diagnostic Services) protocol over CAN interface. Designed for testing and developing automotive diagnostic systems without requiring physical ECU hardware.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

The VDS provides a complete simulation environment for:
- **Developers** testing diagnostic software
- **QA Engineers** validating diagnostic sequences  
- **Researchers** prototyping new diagnostic features
- **Educators** teaching automotive diagnostics

## Quick start

To build and install the project, navigate to the source directory and run:

```bash
make && make install
```
Currently make install does nothing but creation of some directories in ~/.local, later we will implement the true installation.

Running the Virtual Diagnostic Server
The server requires a virtual CAN (vcan) interface. The provided run_server script will attempt to load the necessary kernel modules and activate the vcan interface automatically.

Prerequisites
If the run_server script fails because the vcan module is not available on your system, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y linux-modules-extra-$(uname -r)
```

To run the virtual diagnostic server on Windows (typically within WSL), you must first build a Linux kernel with the vcan module enabled. Follow this [guide](https://berkerturk.medium.com/creating-a-virtual-can-network-in-wsl2-7ccdf166367c) to set it up.

## UDS Handlers

Our service handlers are designed as fully modular plugins, providing maximum flexibility and future-proofing for evolving transport layer requirements.

## Upcoming Features
ðŸ”œ Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) Handling - Implement full DTC management including reading, clearing, and status monitoring capabilities (0x19)

ðŸ”œ Security Access Services - Develop comprehensive security access control with authentication and encryption mechanisms (0x27)

ðŸ”œ InputOutput Control Implementation - Add support for vehicle I/O control and manipulation services (0x2F)

ðŸ”œ Routine Services - Implement automated routine execution and control capabilities (0x31)

ðŸ”œ Interchangeable Transport Layer - Create abstract transport interface supporting multiple protocols (Ethernet/DoIP, K-Line, etc.)
